# breast-cancer-biopsy-logistic-regression

**logistic regression using python**
challenge: building a classifier that can determine whether a sample is benign or malignant

# focusing on various metrics:
- radius, 
- texture
- perimeter
- area
- smoothness
- compactness
- concavity
- concave points
- symmetry
- fractal dimension

binary classification model built using a large dataset of labeled biospy samples from breast cancer tumors
